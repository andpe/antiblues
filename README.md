# AntiBlues
A small program that mutes the microphone if it detects that you are typing by listening for keyboard events in Windows.

This program was created simply so its creator can use the keyboard with MX Blue switches without using push-to-talk (and still not have people complain about it being loud).

## TODO
1. Remove the window that opens with the app.
2. Make sampling period, activation point and all that configurable.
